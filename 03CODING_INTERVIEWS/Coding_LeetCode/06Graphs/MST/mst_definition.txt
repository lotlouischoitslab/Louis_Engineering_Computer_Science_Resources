Spanning Tree: A spanning tree is a connected subgraph in an undirected graph where
all vertices are connected with the minimum possible number of edges.

Minimum Spanning Tree: MST is a spanning tree with the minimum possible total edge weight
in a weighted undirected graph

Cut: A cut is a partition of vertices in a graph in two disjoint sets

Crossing Edge: AN edge that connected a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other set. 

Idea behind Kruskal's Algorithm: Add edges with the least weight and do not create any cycles. Among the edges that don't create a cycle, pick the edge with least weight.
