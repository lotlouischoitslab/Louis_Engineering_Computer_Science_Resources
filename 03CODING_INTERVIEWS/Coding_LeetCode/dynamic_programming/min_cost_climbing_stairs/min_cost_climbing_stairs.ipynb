    "Tabulation: \n",
    "Runtime Analysis: O(N) where N is the size of list cost + 1 because we have a for loop that iterates from i = 2 to cost_size + 1 both inclusive, so we do a traversal of our array dp. In the case of memoization, it's also O(N) because we have N recursive calls where we make use of recurrence relation, which requires two recursive invocations. When we first encounter an unique input aside from the base cases, we will use our recurrence relation. When we encounter the same input again, we will ook for a cache for a constant lookup/retrieval. Tabulation is more runtime efficient than memoization because it gets rid of that recursive overhead of making the recursive calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(N) where N is once again the size of the vector cost. In the case of memoization, we have a recursion stack that stores recursive calls that cannot be immediately resolved by cache lookup and we need to store N such recursive calls before we hit a base case and execute these recursive calls in LIFO order starting from the base case. In the case of tabulation, we have an array that stores size of cost + 1 elements, and this serves as the auxiliary data structure since the only value we really need to return in the end is what is located at index cost[len(cost)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tabulation without array (State Reduction):\n",
    "Notice that we really only every ask our array what is located at index i - 1 and index i - 2 to be able to determine the value that we should store at index i. We can instead replace this entire array with two pointers that I will call prev_step and prev_prev_step. prev_step will store the minimum cost to reach the previous step, or the step at index i - 1. prevprev_step will store the minimum cost to reach its previous step, or the step at index i - 2. Now, we only need to figure out how to change the values of our pointers every iteration of our loop. On the next iteration, what was originially at index i will now be at index i - 1 and what was originally at index i - 1 will be at index i - 2. So, every iteration, we will want to update prev_step to now store min(prev_step + cost[i - 1], prev_prev_step + cost[i-2]). Before this, let's have a temporary pointer to store prev_step's value (i.2 before the update) so that we can update prevprev_Step to hold this value.\n",
    "At the very beginning, we will have prev_step and prevprev_Step store 0's since we start from the step with index 0 or the stpe with index 1, so there is no cost associated with reaching these steps. On the next iteration, the current step becomes the previous step. The previous step becomes the previous step of where the current step is now. This is why we update prev_step to the minimum cost to reach the current step. We are forward thinking, so in the next iteration, this really will become the previous step. Typically, space reductions for space complexity applies to the bottom up approach by getting rid of the array dp and replacing it with variables for whatever previous states we need to keep track of. Improvements in time complexity by reducing the number of state variables apply to both the top-down and bottom-up implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1) because we don't have any additional auxiliary data structures (such as an array in the previous unoptimized approach). We simply maintain two pointers: prev_step and prev_prev step. Which overall require only constant memory usage. "
