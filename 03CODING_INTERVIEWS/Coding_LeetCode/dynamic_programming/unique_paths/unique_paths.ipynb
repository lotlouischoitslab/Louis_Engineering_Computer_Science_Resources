    "1. A function or data structure to compute/hold the answer to the problem for every state\n",
    "We will make use of a recursive helper function dp. It will take as input the current row index and the current column index. The entry corresponding to this row and column index represents the top-left corner of either the entire grid or just a submatrix of it if both the current row and column index are not both 0. The purpose of the function dp is to compute the number of unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (i.e grid[n-1][n-1]) starting from the top left corner whose coordinates are the current row and current column passed in as input to the function dp. We will also incorporate a cache to memoize our results so that we don't re-compute the result of a subproblem that has already been encountered, thereby reducing the runtime from O(2^(m*n)) where m = number of rows in the frid and m = number of columns in grid to just O(m*n). In other words, we will not re-compute the result for an input we've already encounter. So, we will maintain a cach mapping from a tuple pair as a key to an int as a value where the tuple pair represents our current grid position and the int represent the number of paths starting from the tuple pair coordinates as the top-left corner of a matrix to the bottom right-corner of the matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Tabulation, we will maintain a 2d array whose dimensions match the paramters (i.e. its number of rows is m and the row indices range from 0 to m - 1 and its number of columns is n and the column indices range from 0 to n - 1). Each of dp's entries will store the number of unique paths starting from the current 2d array dp position as the top-left corner of a matrix/sub-matrix to the bottom-right corner of the entire 2d array (i.e dp[m-1][n-1]). We will need to iterate backwards since we only know that the number of unique paths for all of the last row and last column entries of the grid will be 1. This is because for the bottom row of the grid, there is no entry below it, meaning that the number of unique paths can only be equal to the number of unique paths of the matrix entry to the right of the current one in the last row. Once we recah the rightmost element in the last row, we will return 1 and then in the case of the top-down approach, we would have executed the recursive calls in LIFO order, each time updating the entries in the bottom row all to 1. Likewise, for the rightmost column, there is no entry to the right of the each entry in the rightmost column, so we can also set them to 1 since they can only be equal to the matrix results below them.Since we know the results for our last row and last column, we will need to start from them and work our way to the top-left corner of the grid (i.e dp[0][0]).\n",

    "2. A recurrence relation to transition between states.\n",
    "We know that we can only move down or right from our current matrix position in an attempt to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. So, the number of unique paths from our current grid position is the sum of the number of unique paths from the matrix entry below us plus the number of unique paths from matrix entry to the right of us. \n",

    "3. Base Case to stop recursion\n",
    "As we determined above, when we are at the last row or the last column of the grid, the number of unique paths to reach the bottom right-corner of the matrix is 1. This is because once we reach the bottom-right corner, and we have a sub-matrix of only one entry, the top-left corner and bottom-right corner of the submatrix are the exact same, meaning that the number of unique paths to reach the bottom right corner would be 1 since we are already at the bottom right corner. If we are in the last row of the grid, the only way to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid is to move to the right, so there is once again only one unique path to reach the bottom-right corner. If we are in the last column of the grid, the only way to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid is to move down, so there is only one unique path once again to reach the bottom-right corner. \n",

    "Top-Down Approach (Memoization)\n",
    "Runtime Analysis: We will implement our recurrence relation and compute the number of unique paths with the row and column index passed in as input to the function dp serving as the top left corner of a matrix/sub-matrix. This means that every time we encounter a duplicate input, we re-use the same result we cached in our dictionary. So, as opposed to a branching factor of 2 that we would incur if we didn't memoize our results, we will retain in our recursion stack recursive calls with unique inputs. If we encounter a duplicate input, we could perform a constant-time lookup from our dictionary and immediately resolve call. However, for recursive calls with unique inputs, they are pushed to the recursion stack and executed in LIFO order once the base case is hit. We will have exactly n * n recursive calls with unique inputs (one for each i and j pair that range from 0 to n - 1, respectively). So, the number of unique inputs for which we will need to compute the number of unique paths starting from the coordinate (i,j) as the top-left corner of a matrix/sub-matrix to the bottom right corner of the grid is exactly n * n. Therefore our overall runtime is O(n*n). \n",
    "\n",
    "Optimized Bottom-Up Approach:\n",
    "Notice that a 2d matrix dp may not actually be necessary. Based on our recurrence relation, whenever we encounter a unique input, the only data we need are either our next row's entries or our next column's entries (one or the other but not both). So, let's go by what's smaller: the number of rows or number of columns. If our grid has less rows, then we will need a list of next column entries (since the number of entries in a 1d array representing the number of columns is n) and a list for our current column entries so that we can set our next column to our current column as we iterate backwards. If our grid has less columns, then we will need a list of next row entries (since the number of elements in the 1d array representing a particular row is n) and a list for our current row entries so that we can set our next row to our current row as we iterate backwards at the end of the body of the outer loop. Our choice of a next row list or next column list enforces the order in which we can go through the rows and columns in the grid. If we wre to mantain a next row list, we would need to iterate backwards through the rows in the outer loop so that we can always update the next row before moving on to the next iteration (or go backwards through the rows). If we were to maintain a next column list, we would need to iterate backwards through the columns in the outer loop so that we can always update the next column before moving on to the previous column (which is considered )\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: We maintain both a recursion stack implicitely and a cache to memoize our results explicitely. As we determined above, an upper bound on the number of recursive calls that our recursion stack will store is n*n. Only once we hit our base cases can we execute these recursive calls in LIFO order and determine the number of unique paths from the top-left corner of the overall grid (i.e. grid[0][0]) to the bottom-right corner of the overall grid (i.e. grid[n-1][n-1]). So, the memory footprint of our recursion stack is O(n*n). Also, we created a dictionary mapping from a coordinate as a tuple key to the number of unique paths as a value. We will have an upper bound of n*n on the number of unique pairings since we have n * n unique coordinates on our grid. So, the memory consumption of our dictionary will also be O(m*n). Therefore, our overall memory usage for the top-down approach is O(n*n). \n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: Our space complexity will reduce down to O(min(m,n)). We may potentially rotate our matrix if the number of rows is less than the number of columns originally in the grid. We would like for the number at rows to be greater than the number of columns since the next row list would then consist of less entries, which would be significant if there was a large difference in the size of each dimension. So, the size of the next row list and the current row list from our 2d matrix dp will be the number of columns potentially after rotation whereby the number of columns becomes less than the number of rows. These are the only auxillary data structures in our implemention, so our overall memory usage O(n,n)"
