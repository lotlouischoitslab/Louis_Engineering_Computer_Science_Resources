    "# Algorithm\n",
    "#We will take advantage of the first use case for BFS, which is traversing every node in the full n-ary tree. We will need to traverse the entire tree level-by-level, which is our intuition behind implemeting BFS. We will need to fully process one level before moving onto the next level. We need to return a 2d matrix where each of its elements is a list containing the node values of a particular level. This is the return value for the level order function, so it's not an auxillary data structure and won't be considered for the memory consumption of this algorithm. Therefore, our only auxillary data structure will be a queue containing nodes from the tree. We will implement both an outer whilte loop and inner for loop where the outer loop will run for H iterations where H is the height of the full n-ary tree. During each outer loop iteration, the inner for loop will go through all of the nodes of a particular level and add it to a list of level nodes to be appended to the list of all nodes. We must keep track of the number of children we push to the queue from the previous level, so that we pop exactly this number of nodes on the next outer while loop iteration. This way, we don;t pop from the queue when it's empty. \n",
    "\n",
    "#Runtime Analysis: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the N-ary tree since we do a full traversal of the tree. The outer while loop will run for H iterations where H is the height of the n-ary tree since it goes level by level until there are no more levels left (i.e we're at the leaf node with the furthest distance from the root node). For this leaf node, it doesn't have children nodes, so we don't pus hanything back into the stack and it ends up empty, causing it to break out of the outer while loop due to the loop condition. The inner for loop will run for a total sum of N iterations across the H iterations of the outer while loop. We only process the node in the inner for loop so the runtime for this for loop is what matters. So the iteration in the inner for loop will dominate the runtime. By 'process', we mean that we pop the node from the queue and then observe its children nodes, deciding which to push back into the queue as long as it isn't None.  Therefore, the overall runtime of this algorithm is O(N)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the N-ary tree since the upper bound on the number of nodes in the queue should hold N. We are required to return a 2d matrix of nodes where each list in the 2d matrix consists of the nodes in that particular level of the tree, and if we were to provide a level as an index into the first dimension, we'll retrieve list corresponding to the nodes traversed in that particular level. As the 2d matrix required, it isn't an auxillary data structure and thus won't be considered towards the memory consumption of this entire algorithm. Our only auxillary data structure is the queue. We're not given the exact number of nodes that a particular level of the N-ary tree will contain, so the overall space complexity would be proportional, in reality, to the max number of nodes in any particular level of the N-ary tree. We can only provide N as an upper bound since our queue can't hold more than the total number of nodes in the input graph, so our overall memory usage is O(N). "
