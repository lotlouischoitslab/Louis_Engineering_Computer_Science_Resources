    "#We will create a helper function where the first parameter is the list of nums and the second parameter is the earnings thus far.\n",
    "#Base Case: if nums is empty, return the number of points you have accumulated up to that point -> second parameter of helper function.\n",
    "# Inside of our recursive helper function, we will need to consider every index of the list nums that remains up to that point for manual deletion. Then we will have to do a full pass through the vector and consider which elements to delete automatically depending on whether that are equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1. Finally now, after doing this can we make a recursive call (inside of our loop) where we provide the first argument, i.e the subarray of nums, and the second argument, the number of points we have accumulated after deleting nums[i]. After this recursive call, we will need to add the deleted elements back to the arrya in the same exact position so that the deleted elements do not have an effect on future recursive calls (and all possibilities are considered). \n",
    "#To do this, we can store a copy of the vector before deletions and then assign the list back to the copy after deletions. \n",

    "#State variable: Index i of the vector we want to delete.\n",
    "#1. A function/ data structure to compute/hold the answer to the problem for every state.\n",
    "#In the memoization approach, function dp will return the maximum number of points we can earn from applying the delete and earn operation on either the first instance of the most frequently occuring element of nums or the first instance of the maximum element of nums (if the frequency of all elements are the exact same).\n",
    "#2. A recurrence relation to transition between states\n",
    "\n",
    "#We simply make a recursive call to obtain the future earnings and then add it to the element we decided to delete during this recursive call. This will give us the maximum earnings corresponding to the input array nums.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Base case to stop recursion so it doesn't continue on infinitely\n",
    "#If nums is empty, return 0 since you don't have any earnings when there's nothing to delete and take on the value of. "
