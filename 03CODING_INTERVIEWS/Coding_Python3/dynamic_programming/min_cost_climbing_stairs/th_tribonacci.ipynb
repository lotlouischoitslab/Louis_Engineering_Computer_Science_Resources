If we see the same input again, we will look to our cache for its tribonacci number in constant time and immediately return it. This does not require re-calculating the tribonacci number and thus re-using the recurrence relation. Therefore we will only use the recurrence relation for each unique input from n to base cases. In the tabulation approach, we have a for loop that iterates from i = 3 to n, so we do a traversal of our array dp. Therefore our overall runtime would be O(n) for both approaches.\n",

In the case of memoization, we have a recursion stack that stores the recursive calls for each unique input from n down to the base case cases so that when the base cases are reached, we can stop recursing and then execute the recursive calls in the stack in LIFO order until we figure out he tribonacci number for input n. IN the tabulation approach, we have an auxiliary data structure (i.e array) with size n + 1 to store each of the tribonacci number corresponding to the array index. In both cases, our overall memory usage is O(n).\n",

    "#Every iteration of our loop, we will need to change prev 3 to hold prev 2's value and prev2 to hold prev1's value. Lastly, prev one need to store the tribonacci number of i which is simply the result of the recurrence relation. We will need temporary pointers in between to hold the tribonacci numbers at index i - 1 and index i -2 in order to successfully perform the update. \n",
